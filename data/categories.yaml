# PDA Resource Categories
# Organized by clinical utility for French clinicians encountering PDA for the first time
#
# Structure mirrors how a clinician thinks:
#   "What is this thing?" → "How do I recognize it?" → "What do I do about it?"
#
# OVERLAP HANDLING:
#   Resources often span multiple categories. Each resource gets:
#   - primary_category: main classification, determines where it appears in navigation
#   - secondary_categories: additional relevant categories (optional, list)
#
#   On the site, resources appear in their primary category's section,
#   with cross-references or tags indicating secondary categories.
#   Search/filter can surface resources by any of their categories.
