  summary_en: This qualitative study explored the experiences and support needs of
    ten mothers of autistic children with a PDA profile. Parents reported limited
    understanding of PDA among professionals, resulting in misinterpretation, stigma,
    and inadequate or even harmful support. Mothers described highly demanding relationships
    with their children, significant emotional toll, isolation, and challenges balancing
    family needs, while also finding relief, validation, and practical strategies
    through shared understanding with other parents. The study highlights the need
    for greater recognition of PDA, flexible low-demand approaches, and informed services
    that can support both children and their families effectively.

  summary_en: 'The study explored the experiences and support needs of parents caring
    for autistic children who display Extreme or Pathological Demand Avoidance (E/PDA)
    behaviours. Through interviews with 21 parents, the researchers identified four
    key themes: a lack of understanding and recognition of E/PDA by professionals,
    the blaming and judgment of parents through a neuro-normative lens, inadequate
    and non-individualised support, and significant emotional and relational distress
    experienced by families. These findings reveal a harmful cycle in which poor understanding
    leads to inappropriate responses and unmet needs, compounding the challenges faced
    by both children and their families. The study emphasizes the urgent need for
    E/PDA-informed training, personalised support strategies, and a shift away from
    rigid diagnostic categories toward more nuanced, formulation-based approaches
    in service provision.'
  summary_fr: Cette étude a exploré les expériences et les besoins d'accompagnement
    des parents d'enfants autistes présentant des comportements d'évitement extrême
    ou pathologique des demandes (E/PDA). À travers des entretiens menés auprès de
    21 parents, les chercheurs ont identifié quatre thématiques centrales — un manque
    de compréhension et de reconnaissance du E/PDA par les professionnels, la culpabilisation
    et le jugement des parents à travers un prisme neuro-normatif, un accompagnement
    inadapté et non individualisé, ainsi qu'une détresse émotionnelle et relationnelle
    significative vécue par les familles. Ces résultats révèlent un cycle délétère
    dans lequel une mauvaise compréhension engendre des réponses inappropriées et
    des besoins non satisfaits, aggravant les difficultés rencontrées tant par les
    enfants que par leurs familles. L'étude souligne la nécessité urgente de formations
    spécifiques au E/PDA, de stratégies d'accompagnement personnalisées, et d'une
    évolution des pratiques s'éloignant des catégories diagnostiques rigides au profit
    d'approches centrées sur une compréhension individualisée des besoins.

    Findings reveal significant struggles with school attendance, high exclusion rates,
    and a widespread lack of appropriate support. The study emphasises the need for
    Education, Health, and Care Plans (EHCPs) that accurately reflect a child’s specific
    needs. Additionally, it discusses the value of a formal PDA diagnosis in securing

  summary_en: This qualitative study explored practising psychologists’ understandings
    and clinical experiences of demand avoidance and extreme demand avoidance (EDA)
    in children and adolescents. Through semi-structured interviews, psychologists
    described demand avoidance as a spectrum of behaviours, with EDA characterised
    by intense anxiety, need for control, and extreme responses to everyday demands.
    Participants highlighted significant challenges in assessment, including overlap
    with other neurodevelopmental and mental health presentations, inconsistent terminology,
    and limited consensus about EDA as a distinct profile. Psychologists emphasised
    that traditional behavioural or compliance-based approaches often escalated distress,
    whereas flexible, relational, low-demand, and anxiety-informed strategies were
    perceived as more effective. The study highlights the need for clearer conceptual
    frameworks, improved professional training, and greater consistency in assessment
    and support approaches to better meet the needs of children and adolescents with
    high demand avoidance.

  authors: Grace Trundle, Katy A. Jones, Danielle Ropar and Vincent Egan
  summary_en: This quantitative study examined the relationships between social camouflaging,
    autism traits, Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) traits, victimisation, and
    offending in a general population sample of 220 adults. Findings showed that higher
    levels of camouflaging were associated with increased lifetime offending and greater
    experiences of victimisation, although camouflaging itself did not directly predict
    victimisation when mental health factors were accounted for. PDA traits were significant
    predictors of both victimisation and lifetime offending, while higher autism traits
    were associated with fewer offending behaviours. Symptoms of depression and anxiety
    played a key role in predicting victimisation and indirectly influenced offending.
    The study highlights the complex interplay between camouflaging, mental health,
    and neurodevelopmental traits, emphasising the need for trauma-informed, autism-
    and PDA-aware systems to reduce misinterpretation, harm, and unnecessary criminalisation.

    In Experiment 1, an online survey of 163 adults found that both general anxiety
    (measured by MASQ‑D30) and IU (via IUS‑12) were significant predictors of PDA
    traits (via the EDA‑QA). In Experiment 2, follow‑up interviews with 13 participants
    revealed four key themes shaping demand‑avoidant behaviour: the dynamic between
    approach and avoidance, factors biasing anticipation of demands, underlying vulnerabilities,
    and developmental patterns. Collectively, the findings suggest that anxiety and
    IU continue to underpin and maintain PDA-like behaviours in adults, with anticipatory
    responses playing a critical role in triggering avoidance.'

  summary_en: 'The EDA-8 is a shorter version of the Extreme Demand Avoidance Questionnaire
    (EDA-Q), first developed in 2013 by Dr. Liz O’Nions and colleagues. The original
    EDA-Q measured caregiver-reported behaviours linked to Extreme or Pathological
    Demand Avoidance (PDA) in autistic children aged 5-17. It was created for research,
    not diagnosis. In 2021, the EDA-Q was refined into the EDA-8, an 8-item measure
    that focuses on the most consistent traits of PDA. Less reliable items, such as
    those influenced by age, gender, or independence, were removed. The EDA-8 is designed
    for research purposes and has not yet been tested in clinical settings.

    PLEASE NOTE:


    No clinician-rated instrument for identifying a PDA profile has yet been developed
    and tested. However, a range of tools have been developed for research purposes
    which can be a helpful aid for practitioners exploring a PDA profile. The EDA-8
    is one such tool with other tools listed in section ‘4.3. Diagnostic Tools’ of
    our ‘Practice Guidance for Identifying and Assessing a PDA profile’.


    The EDA-8 asks about a person’s presentation not the causation of this presentation.
    There are a range of reasons why a person may present with extreme demand avoidance
    besides PDA. Therefore, a high score on the measure does not in itself indicate
    a PDA profile. More in-depth assessment is needed to establish whether a PDA profile
    is underpinning demand avoidance behaviours. This would consider early development
    and take into account any situational factors affecting current behaviour.


    The questionnaire is intended for use by researchers wanting to measure extreme
    demand avoidance traits.

    on PDA is still in its early stages due to limited funding, and more work is required
    to determine how useful the concept is. The review emphasises the importance of
    longitudinal studies to track avoidant behaviours over time, as well as research
    into the role of anxiety, trauma, and environmental factors in PDA. Although the
    review predates key clinically based research (such as Eaton and Weaver), it reinforces
    the need for systematic studies to assess whether PDA as a concept leads to better
    outcomes. The authors stress that continued research is essential to understand
    and validate PDA’s role in diagnosis and intervention.

    PDA, exhibited more challenging behaviours in school. However, school exclusions
    occurred across all groups, highlighting broader concerns about how autistic students
    are supported. Parents reported overwhelmingly negative school experiences, often
    attributing them to a lack of understanding of their child’s needs and insufficient

    with PDA, some of which had not been previously documented. While the study does
    not claim PDA is a separate diagnosis, it adds to the evidence suggesting PDA

  summary_en: This article provides an overview of Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA),
    focusing on how it presents in autistic children. The authors discuss key differences
    between children with a PDA profile and those with attachment difficulties. They
    explore how anxiety-driven avoidance of everyday demands can develop and highlight
    strategies to help reduce avoidance behaviours. These include creating positive
    routines that gradually increase a child’s tolerance for demands while avoiding
    reinforcement of avoidance behaviours. The article emphasises that recognising
    the PDA profile can help caregivers and educators better understand and support
    autistic children who struggle with daily requests. While PDA is not a standalone
    diagnosis, describing its traits can improve care and educational approaches for
    affected children.

  summary_en: 'This paper challenges the usefulness of Pathological Demand Avoidance
    (PDA) as a diagnostic label from a social science and critical autism studies
    perspective. It argues that PDA may pathologize behaviours that are simply nonconforming
    to neurotypical expectations rather than indicative of a distinct disorder.


    The author suggests that demand avoidance may be a rational response for autistic
    individuals, rather than a sign of defiance or disorder. Labelling young people
    as having PDA, the paper argues, risks reinforcing misunderstandings about autism
    and making them vulnerable to unnecessary interventions. It calls for a re-examination
    of how PDA is framed and whether it reflects a genuine clinical need or a failure
    to understand autistic behaviours.'

  summary_en: 'This paper examines the validity of the Extreme Demand Avoidance Questionnaire
    for Adults (EDA-QA) as a screening tool for identifying Pathological Demand Avoidance
    (PDA) traits in adults. Two studies were conducted using participants recruited
    from online forums focused on autism-related topics.


    Participants completed either the full or short form of the Autism Screening Questionnaire
    (ASQ), alongside other recognised measures of behavioural and personality traits
    linked to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study analysed the overlap between
    these scores and EDA-QA results, concluding that the EDA-QA can effectively screen
    for PDA traits in adults.


    This research is valuable for professionals working in adult autism assessments
    and individuals seeking diagnostic pathways for PDA. It highlights the need for
    further investigation into PDA in adulthood and the development of clinical tools
    to support accurate identification and intervention.'

  summary_en: This study examines how parents of autistic children, including those
    with a Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) profile, adapt their parenting strategies.
    Researchers used the ‘Parenting Strategies Questionnaire’ to assess how parents
    manage challenging behaviours. Findings show that parents of autistic children
    with problem behaviours are more likely to accommodate their child’s needs by
    making adjustments or reducing uncertainty. Interestingly, the study found no
    significant differences in the use of discipline, rewards, or reinforcement strategies
    based on the child’s behaviour. This research is one of the first to highlight
    how parents naturally adjust their approaches based on their child’s unique behavioural
    profile. Understanding these adaptations may help improve parenting support for
    families of autistic children.

  summary_en: 'Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) is widely considered part of the
    autism spectrum, but research in this area is still developing. There are different
    viewpoints, and more high-quality studies are urgently needed. Researchers need
    to better understand both autism and demand avoidance, identify effective support
    strategies, and establish clear ways to describe the PDA profile.


    In early 2019, the PDA Society hosted a research meeting with academics and other
    experts from the UK and Ireland. The event allowed researchers to share their
    latest findings, discuss key ideas, and identify the most important research priorities.
    The goal was to build a shared understanding and focus on practical ways to support
    individuals with PDA. All 31 participants agreed that the meeting was valuable
    and productive. More collaboration and research are needed to improve knowledge
    and support for those with PDA.'

  summary_en: 'This article explores the debate around whether extreme/pathological
    demand avoidance (E/PDA) is part of the autism spectrum or a separate condition.
    It provides an overview of current research and compares behaviours seen in classic
    autism with those in individuals with a strong demand avoidant profile. The paper
    describes challenging behaviours linked to E/PDA and the difficulties faced by
    caregivers and schools.


    The research also examines similarities and differences between E/PDA, Oppositional
    Defiant Disorder (ODD), and Conduct Disorder (CD). While some behaviours overlap,
    E/PDA appears distinct. The article discusses how E/PDA may resemble a “female-typical”
    autism presentation, where symptoms can be harder to recognise. Finally, the paper
    outlines strategies for managing E/PDA behaviours and stresses the need for more
    research on recognition, diagnosis, and support. Raising awareness is crucial
    to improving understanding and intervention for individuals with E/PDA.'

  summary_en: 'This commentary by Malik and Baird discusses the challenges of defining
    and diagnosing Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA). It responds to O’Nions et
    al.’s 2017 paper, Dimensions of Difficulty in Children with Autism and Extreme
    Demand Avoidance, by emphasising the need to look beyond demand avoidance itself
    and consider its underlying causes.


    The authors argue that using PDA as a distinct label may be unhelpful, as it could
    overlook the complex factors driving these behaviours. They suggest that identifying
    and addressing the child’s specific difficulties-such as anxiety, sensory sensitivities,
    or difficulties with flexibility-may be more beneficial than applying a PDA diagnosis.
    The paper raises concerns that the PDA label could lead to misunderstandings and
    potentially limit effective interventions. Instead, they advocate for a broader,
    needs-based approach to assessment and support for children displaying extreme
    demand avoidance.'

  summary_en: 'This research explores how well children understand others’ thoughts
    and feelings, known as Theory of Mind (ToM). It compares children with and without
    Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) and finds that stronger ToM skills are linked
    to lower aggression, especially in younger children. The study also shows that
    children with ASC generally have lower ToM abilities, and those with better ToM
    experience fewer difficulties with socialising and communication.


    The research further examines Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), a behavioural
    pattern where children strongly resist demands. PDA traits are often linked to
    behavioural difficulties, stress for parents, and school challenges. However,
    this study finds no connection between PDA and ToM, suggesting that different
    factors cause PDA behaviours. The findings highlight the need for personalised
    support strategies and early recognition of PDA traits during autism assessments.
    This research contributes valuable insights into an area that requires further

    They highlight research showing that some children with ASD experience demands
    as threatening, leading to extreme avoidance behaviours. Standard behaviour management
    techniques may escalate distress rather than help. Instead of labelling these
    behaviours as defiance, the authors emphasise the need for research into effective

    impulsivity, and manipulative behaviours.


    However, the study underscores key differences, including the underlying causes
    of these behaviours. While PDA-related avoidance is often driven by anxiety and
    an overwhelming need for control, ASPD traits are typically rooted in persistent
    disregard for others and a lack of empathy. The research warns that professionals
    working with offenders who have personality disorders must be cautious to avoid

  summary_en: 'This study explores the behavioural challenges of children with autism
    spectrum disorder (ASD) who also show traits of extreme/pathological demand avoidance
    (PDA). Based on parent interviews, it examines how these children obsessively
    avoid everyday demands, display ‘strategic’ (rather than manipulative) behaviour,
    and experience sudden mood changes.


    Parents identified additional difficulties, such as the child’s need to control
    situations and others’ actions. The study found that extreme behaviours were often
    triggered by emotional responses to pressure, sensory sensitivities, phobias,
    and fear of the unknown. These findings support previous research while also providing
    new insights into how these behaviours manifest.


    The research highlights the importance of addressing these challenges in daily
    life through targeted interventions. It also emphasises the need for further exploration
    of how PDA-related behaviours differ from or overlap with other behavioural profiles

    The research investigates key factors contributing to exclusion and the challenges
    faced by students, parents, and educators in re-integrating them into education.
    Findings highlight the need for better understanding, support strategies, and
    adjustments to ensure autistic students can remain in school. The study calls
    for more inclusive education policies and interventions that recognise the specific
    needs of autistic students, helping to prevent exclusion and support long-term
    educational success.


    This paper is relevant to educators, policymakers, and families seeking to improve
    school experiences for autistic students.'

  summary_en: 'This poster summarises research on the behavioural features of extreme/pathological
    demand avoidance (PDA) using a semi-structured interview with parents of children
    diagnosed with autism who also displayed PDA traits. The study identified key
    areas of difficulty, including struggles with following demands, controlling behaviours,
    extreme reactions, engagement in fantasy/role play, avoidance strategies, poor
    social awareness, and intense emotional instability.


    The findings highlight the significant challenges that PDA behaviours create for
    families and schools. The paper stresses that these behaviours should be properly
    assessed to develop effective management strategies tailored to each child’s needs.
    Recognising and addressing these behavioural difficulties early can help improve
    support for children with PDA, their families, and educators. This research contributes
    to a better understanding of PDA within the autism spectrum and reinforces the
    need for individualised approaches in assessment and intervention.'

  summary_en: 'This study examines parents’ experiences of working with professionals
    to support children with Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA). PDA is characterised
    by an extreme difficulty in tolerating everyday demands, leading to avoidance
    behaviours often described as ‘socially manipulative.’ Children with PDA also
    display impulsivity, obsessive behaviours, and difficulties with social identity.


    While awareness and research on PDA are gradually increasing, parents report ongoing
    struggles in getting their children’s needs recognised and properly addressed
    by health and education services. The study explores what parents value most in
    professional involvement, highlighting the importance of understanding, flexibility,
    and tailored support approaches. The findings emphasise the need for improved
    awareness and training among professionals to ensure families receive appropriate
    guidance and intervention. This research is particularly relevant for educators,
    clinicians, and policymakers looking to improve outcomes for children with PDA
    and their families.'

  summary_en: 'This study explores the educational experiences of children with Pathological
    Demand Avoidance (PDA) through parent-reported questionnaires. It aims to provide
    insight for educators and parents navigating the education system with a PDA child.


    Findings confirm that children with PDA face significant challenges in school,
    displaying high levels of behavioural difficulties. Despite receiving extensive
    special educational needs (SEN) support and professional involvement, many still
    experience school exclusions and placement breakdowns. However, parents rated
    their child’s current school placement moderately positively, with an average
    ‘success’ score of 6/10.


    The study highlights the urgent need for tailored educational approaches for children
    with PDA. It also discusses the implications of these findings by comparing them
    to the experiences of children with more typical autism spectrum conditions. The
    research underscores the importance of understanding PDA-specific needs to improve
    inclusion and long-term educational outcomes.

  summary_en: 'This study examines the prevalence of Pathological Demand Avoidance
    (PDA) within a general population of individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum
    Disorder (ASD) in the Faroe Islands. Researchers screened all 15 to 24-year-olds
    for ASD, identifying 67 individuals who met the diagnostic criteria. Parents of
    50 of these individuals were interviewed using the Diagnostic Interview for Social
    and Communication Disorders (DISCO), which includes 15 PDA-specific items.


    The study found that nine individuals (around 20% of those with ASD) had shown
    PDA traits in childhood. However, by the time of assessment, only one person still
    met the full PDA criteria. The findings suggest that while PDA traits may be present
    in childhood, they may not persist into late adolescence and early adulthood in
    the same way. This study is a thought-provoking read for professionals and those
    interested in PDA diagnosis and classification.'

  summary_en: 'This poster provides a visual summary of research on how the Diagnostic
    Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) can help identify Pathological
    Demand Avoidance (PDA). The study aimed to pinpoint which DISCO items best distinguish
    PDA from other autism spectrum profiles and to analyse the behavioural traits
    of individuals with PDA.


    Using data from a previous parent-report study, researchers identified eleven
    DISCO items strongly associated with PDA. These included behaviours like ‘lack
    of co-operation,’ ‘apparently manipulative behaviour,’ ‘difficulties with others,’
    and ‘repetitive acting out roles.’ While PDA traits overlapped with core autism
    spectrum disorder (ASD) features, the PDA group displayed more extreme behavioural
    challenges. The findings highlight the need for tailored assessment tools to accurately
    identify PDA traits. This research helps improve understanding of PDA within the
    autism spectrum and informs future diagnostic approaches.'

    The study identified eleven DISCO items that strongly align with PDA. A group

    their characteristics matched earlier descriptions of PDA by Elizabeth Newson
    and colleagues. The paper emphasises the need for a clinician-rated tool to assess
    PDA features more systematically. It also calls for further research to clarify

  summary_en: 'This paper presents four case studies exploring the relationship between
    Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) and epilepsy in children. The study highlights
    the complexity of neurodevelopmental conditions and the frequent overlap of multiple
    diagnoses.


    The case studies demonstrate how children with epilepsy may also exhibit extreme
    demand avoidance, emphasising the need for holistic assessments that consider
    PDA traits. The paper underscores the importance of identifying PDA within broader
    neurodevelopmental evaluations to ensure appropriate support and intervention.
    Recognising demand avoidance in children with epilepsy can help tailor educational
    and clinical approaches to meet their needs effectively.


    This research contributes to the growing understanding of PDA as part of a broader
    spectrum of neurodevelopmental challenges and reinforces the necessity of individualised
    assessments for children with complex medical and behavioural profiles. It is
    particularly relevant for clinicians, educators, and researchers studying developmental

  summary_en: 'This commentary by Christopher Gillberg provides a historical perspective
    on Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) and its classification. Drawing from 40
    years of experience in child and adolescent psychiatry, Gillberg suggests that
    PDA is not rare and often coexists with conditions like ADHD, anorexia nervosa,
    and other behavioural syndromes. He acknowledges PDA as a significant clinical
    issue that requires greater understanding.


    The paper praises the development of the Extreme Demand Avoidance Questionnaire
    (EDA-Q) by Elizabeth O’Nions et al., discussing its usefulness and the need for
    further research. Gillberg proposes renaming PDA to Extreme Demand Avoidance (EDA)
    to avoid confusion with “Public Displays of Affection” and to emphasize the undeniable
    severity of the avoidance. He argues that while the demand avoidance is extreme,
    debates will continue about whether it is truly pathological. This article is
    a thought-provoking read for professionals and parents alike.'

    Conduct Problems (CPs), and Callous-Unemotional Traits (CUs). The research aimed
    to explore whether PDA should be considered a distinct syndrome and addressed
    ongoing debates around its classification.


    Using standardised parent-report measures, the study found that children with
    PDA exhibited severe impairments across multiple areas. Social difficulties in
    PDA were similar to those seen in ASD, while antisocial traits and reduced pro-social
    behaviours resembled those found in CP/CU groups. The paper discusses management
    strategies tailored to each group, emphasising the particular challenges faced
    by children with PDA traits. It also highlights the need for further research
    into the neurocognitive basis of PDA and potential interventions. This study contributes
    to the growing understanding of PDA and its place within developmental disorders.'

    to quantify PDA-related behaviours.


    The research concluded that the EDA-Q is a useful tool for identifying PDA traits
    in children, though it is not a formal diagnostic test. Instead, it provides a
    standardised way for researchers and clinicians to measure PDA tendencies for
    study purposes. While aimed at professionals, the paper may also interest parents

  summary_en: 'This paper by Elizabeth Newson and colleagues aimed to establish Pathological
    Demand Avoidance (PDA) as a distinct condition within the Pervasive Developmental
    Disorders (PDDs), now classified as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). Newson identified
    a group of children with severe behavioural difficulties who did not fit traditional
    autism or Asperger’s syndrome criteria. Many had been diagnosed with PDD – Not
    Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS), which often led to confusion and inappropriate
    management strategies.


    Newson’s research, based on children seen in her clinics between 1975 and 2000,
    demonstrated key behavioural differences that supported PDA as a separate diagnosis.
    A follow-up study of individuals aged 16-32 confirmed the robustness of Newson’s
    original descriptions into adulthood. Since this paper’s publication, recognition
    of PDA within the autism spectrum has grown significantly. However, it remains
    an important read for parents and professionals seeking to understand the value
    of accurate diagnosis for effective intervention.'
